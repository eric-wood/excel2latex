# Excel => LaTeX

Check out the [demo](http://ericwood.org/excel2latex/).

A silly Javascript tool for converting Excel spreadsheets into LaTeX tables.

Right now I don't have any settings for what the resulting table looks like...I want to add this eventually, it's not difficult or anything. Sorry in advance if the formatting isn't what you're looking for, I'll make it more flexible in the future!

I just whipped this up in a few hours for fun, and haven't really tested it much. Pleasepleaseplease let me know if you manage to break it, I'd really appreciate it.

### Compatability

Not completely sure, but most likely newer versions of Chrome, Firefox, and IE 10 will work great with this. Only tested on Chrome...this is just a little experiment ;)

### Shout outs

Thanks to [zip.js](http://gildas-lormeau.github.com/zip.js/) for making this thing possible. It's a badass library.
